        The token could be successfully decoded in jwt's website, so not sure what is wrong about the jwt form. The UserButton gets my data, and shows my github profile image. My clerk's dashboard also shows my github account has successfully signed in, but no user because jwt token invalid.

        I personally think this is a bug on app router. I've tried to downgrade my next, clerk to Theo's version, but the result is still the same. Another possibility is pnpm. I'm using v9 and Theo is using v8.
